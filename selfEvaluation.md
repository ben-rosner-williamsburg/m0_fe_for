# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
I feel very confident in my understanding and fluency with the for statement. I understand all three elements: the initialization, the condition and the final expression. I knw how to iterate through an array comfortably.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I had some productive struggle while completing the challenge. It took me a few attempts to get the result I wanted. It felt good once I had achieved the correct result. I would not say I felt unproductive struggle anythime throughout this assignment.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice and learn more advanced looping techniques. I would also like to learn other types of loops that are used in JS. I will do that by studying the documentation more thoroughly. I will adjust my calendar to do this.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

"What are the other types of loops that are used in JS?" 
"Are there other ways to initialize a for loop besides the way we were taught?"

I can find the answer to these by Googling or checking the docs.
